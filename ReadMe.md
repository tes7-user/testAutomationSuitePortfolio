# Introduction

This repository is a unified test automation suite showcasing cross-framework testing practices using:

- ✅ Cypress (implemented) – targets the **ParaBank Demo Application**
- ✅ Playwright (implemented) – targets the **Shady Meadows B&B Application**
- 🚧 Selenium (coming soon) – testing a different web application

### Why this project?

The goal of this project is to:

- Provide portfolio-quality examples for **interview preparation**, **team onboarding**, or **tool evaluation**
- Apply **design patterns** like the Page Object Model (POM), modular helpers, and clean separation of test logic

### What this project covers:

- Cypress: UI + API for (ParaBank)
- Playwright: UI (AutomShady Meadows B&B)
- Selenium: (coming soon) UI testing on a classic enterprise-style application
- Reusable structure, test case documentation, and scalable folder layout
- Common test flows implemented in multiple frameworks for comparison

> 📝 **Note:** This project demonstrates multiple best practices for learning and showcasing flexibility. In real-world scenarios, teams typically choose a single test framework depending on project goals.

#### Installation

Each test framework is organized in its own folder. Setup instructions are available in each directory:

| Framework  | Folder        | Setup Instructions                             |
| ---------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Cypress    | `/cypress`    | [📘 Cypress README](./cypress/readMe.md)       |
| Playwright | `/playwright` | [📘 Playwright README](./playwright/readMe.md) |
| Selenium   | `/selenium`   | _Coming soon – separate app under test_        |

To run Cypress tests (ParaBank):

cd cypress-tests
npm install
npx cypress open
